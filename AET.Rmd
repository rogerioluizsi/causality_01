This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 
```{r}
install.packages(c('ggplot2','glmnet', 'grf', 'sandwich', 'devtools'))
library(devtools)
install_github("swager/balanceHD")
```


```{r}


library(ggplot2)   # plot
library(glmnet)    # lasso
library(grf)       # generalized random forests
library(sandwich)  # for robust CIs
library(devtools)  # install from GitHub 
library(balanceHD) # approximate residual balancing
```


```{r}
#load data
data<- read.csv('~/features_engeneering/ALL_STUDENTS.csv')
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
